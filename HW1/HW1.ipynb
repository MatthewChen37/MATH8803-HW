    "## Problem 1 - Connor-Stevens Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differential equation for the Connor-Stevens Model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(t) = C (\\frac{dV}{dt}) + g_{L}(V - E_{L}) + g_{Na}(V - E_{Na}) + g_{K}(V - E_{K}) + g_{A}(V - E_{K})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation of Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $ C (\\frac{dV}{dt}) $ - We can think of the membrane as a capacitor and $V$ represents the voltage across the membrane. $C$ is capacitance or $C = \\frac{q}{u} = \\frac{q}{V}$ where $q$ is a charge and $v$ reprecents the voltage across a capacitor. Thus, $ C (\\frac{dV}{dt}) $ is the charging current $I_{c}(t)$ that is applied on the membrane.\n",

    "4. $E_{L}$ - Battery Voltage for Unspecific Third Channel\n",
    "\n",
    "5. $g_{Na} = \\overline{g}_{Na} m^{3}h$ - Sodium Conductance. Here $\\overline{g}_{Na}$ is a normalization constant, $m$ describes the activation/opening of the and $h$ describes the inactivation/blocking of the $Na^{+}$ channels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. $g_{K} = \\overline{g}_{k} n^{4}$ - Delayed Potassium Conductance, where $\\overline{g}_{k}$ is a normalization constant and $n$ controls the $K^{+}$ gates. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. $g_{A} = \\overline{g}_{A} A^{3}B$ - Transient Potassium Conductance, where $\\overline{g}_{A}$ is a normalization factor, $A$ is an activation term, and $B$ is an inactivation term. \n",
